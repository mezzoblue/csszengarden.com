	This xhtml document is marked up to provide the designer with the maximum possible flexibility.
	There are more classes and extraneous tags than needed, and in a real world situation, it's more
	likely that it would be much leaner.
	
	However, I think we can all agree that even given that, we're still better off than if this had been
	built with tables.

Design</SPAN></H2></DIV>
<DIV id=quickSummary>
<P class=p1><SPAN>A demonstration of what can be accomplished visually through 
<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-based design. Select any 
style sheet from the list to load it into this page.</SPAN></P>
<P class=p2><SPAN>Download the sample <A

<DIV id=preamble>
<H3><SPAN>The Road to Enlightenment</SPAN></H3>
<P class=p1><SPAN>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of 
browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr 
title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, and broken <abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support.</SPAN></P>
<P class=p2><SPAN>Today, we must clear the mind of past practices. Web 
enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the 
<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr 
title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr> and the major browser 
creators.</SPAN></P>
<P class=p3><SPAN>The css Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the 
important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the 
(yet to be) time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one 
with the web.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=supportingText>
<DIV id=explanation>
<H3><SPAN>So What is This About?</SPAN></H3>
<P class=p1><SPAN>There is clearly a need for <abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to be taken seriously by graphic 
artists. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To 
begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will 
load the style sheet into this very page. The code remains the same, the only 
thing that has changed is the external .css file. Yes, really.</SPAN></P>
<P class=p2><SPAN><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows 
complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way 
this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating 
what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to 
create beauty from structure. To date, most examples of neat tricks and hacks 
have been demonstrated by structurists and coders. Designers have yet to make 
their mark. This needs to change.</SPAN></P></DIV>
<DIV id=participation>
<H3><SPAN>Participation</SPAN></H3>
<P class=p1><SPAN>Graphic artists only please. You are modifying this page, so 
strong <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are 
necessary, but the example files are commented well enough that even <abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them as starting 
points. Please see the <A title="A listing of CSS-related resources" 
href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/"><abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Resource Guide</A> for advanced 
tutorials and tips on working with <abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</SPAN></P>
<P class=p2><SPAN>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not 
the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem 
daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed 
links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</SPAN></P>
<P class=p3><SPAN>Download the sample <A 
title="This page's source HTML code, not to be modified." 
href="http://www.csszengarden.com/zengarden-sample.html">html file</A> and <A 
title="This page's sample CSS, the file you may modify." 
href="http://www.csszengarden.com/zengarden-sample.css">css file</A> to work on 
a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t 
submit half-finished work) upload your .css file to a web server under your 
control. <A title="Use the contact form to send us your CSS file" 
href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/">Send us a link</A> to the file 
and if we choose to use it, we will spider the associated images. Final 
submissions will be placed on our server.</SPAN></P></DIV>
<DIV id=benefits>
<H3><SPAN>Benefits</SPAN></H3>
<P class=p1><SPAN>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource 
we can all refer to when making the case for <abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-based design. This is sorely 
needed, even today. More and more major sites are taking the leap, but not 
enough have. One day this gallery will be a historical curiosity; that day is 
not today.</SPAN></P></DIV>
<DIV id=requirements>
<H3><SPAN>Requirements</SPAN></H3>
<P class=p1><SPAN>We would like to see as much <abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets, version 1">CSS1</abbr> as possible. <abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets, version 2">CSS2</abbr> should be limited to 
widely-supported elements only. The css Zen Garden is about functional, 
practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the 
latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real 
requirement we have is that your <abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</SPAN></P>
<P class=p2><SPAN>Unfortunately, designing this way highlights the flaws in the 
various implementations of <abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. Different browsers display 
differently, even completely valid <abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> at times, and this becomes 
maddening when a fix for one leads to breakage in another. View the <A 
title="A listing of CSS-related resources" 
href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/">Resources</A> page for 
information on some of the fixes available. Full browser compliance is still 
sometimes a pipe dream, and we do not expect you to come up with pixel-perfect 
code across every platform. But do test in as many as you can. If your design 
doesn’t work in at least IE5+/Win and Mozilla (run by over 90% of the 
population), chances are we won’t accept it.</SPAN></P>
<P class=p3><SPAN>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect 
copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum; tasteful nudity 
is acceptable, outright pornography will be rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P class=p4><SPAN>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You 
retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <A 
href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/">submission 
guidelines</A>), but we ask you release your <abbr 
title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license 
identical to the <A title="View the Zen Garden's license information."
