necessary to use these fonts for personal or commercial use. For Software
Products who want to include these fonts, see the License Agreement below. You

<p>Payment:</p>

<p>No payment is required for the use of this

<ul>
 <li>Q: How can I
     use this font in <a href="http://www.aim.com/">AOL Instant Messenger</a>,
     <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/">MSN Messenger</a>, <a
     href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/">Outlook</a>, <a
     href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/">Outlook Express</a>, <a
     href="http://www.eudora.com/">Euodora</a> or any other email software?</li>
 <li>A: At the
     time of this writing (October 2004) you can’t. After installing one of my
     fonts, you may be able to select it in the above applications but the
     person at the other end won’t see that same thing unless they have the
     font installed. If you really want to use my fonts in these applications,
     make sure the people at the other end have the same fonts installed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: How can I
     use these fonts on a web page?</li>
 <li>A: If you’re
     creating a web page using Flash, it’s easy. Consult your Flash manual. If
     you’re using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/">Acrobat</a>,
     make sure the font embedding settings are turned on. Consult your Acrobat
     manual. For anything else there are limitations: If you want to use one of
     my fonts as your main, text font you’re pretty much out of luck unless you
     explore a font embedding tool such as <a
     href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/weft/">WEFT</a>
     but I don’t recommend it. To use my fonts as headings or titles, use image
     creation software such as <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</a>, <a
     href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">Photoshop</a>, <a
     href="http://www.jasc.com/">Paint Shop Pro</a>, <a
     href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pixia">Pixia</a> etc. Save the images
     as GIF files and place them on your web page. There’s a lot more to it
     than can be explained here but there are countless books available on web
     page design.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: How can I
     make these fonts bigger?</li>
 <li>A: All my
     fonts are infinitely scalable; the limitations are in your software. A
     common problem is scaling fonts in Microsoft Word. If you choose Format /
     Font you can type in any number you like under “size”.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: Are these
     fonts really free?</li>
 <li>A: Yes they
     are.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
 <li>Q: I saw this
     font on another web site under the name Larabie Fonts, why is it listed as
     Typodermic now?</li>
 <li>A: Larabie
     Fonts and Typodermic were both started by Ray Larabie. This font may have been originally released
     under Larabie Fonts. Before Typodermic existed, several freeware fonts
     from Larabie Fonts had expanded families available sold as <i>Deluxe</i>
     versions. When Typodermic came into existence in 2001, the <i>Deluxe</i>
     fonts were gradually renamed and moved to the Typodermic foundry.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
 <li>Q: Is this
     font the same as the “pay” version of the font? For example: is Zekton
     Free the same as Zekton regular?</li>
 <li>A: Yes. There
     is no difference in the quality or completeness between the  free version
     and the pay version; only the name and license agreement is different. If
     you downloaded this font from a site other then Typodermic or MyFonts.com,
     you should visit Typodermic and download the latest version.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: Why would
     I pay for this font when I already have it for free?</li>
 <li>A: If you
     visit Typodermic you can see the difference. The version of the font for
     sale comes with several different styles, making it much more versatile.
     You can purchase the whole font family for what some foundries charge for
     a single font!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: Your
     licence agreement states that the fonts can’t be altered. Does that mean I
     can’t mess around with your fonts in Photoshop/Illustrator/Publisher etc?</li>
 <li>A: Those
     license restrictions refer to altering the actual fonts themselves, not
     what you make with them. As long as you don’t alter the font files in font
     creation software such as FontLab or Fontographer you’re free to create
     anything you like with them.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: Can I use
     your fonts in a logo?</li>
 <li>A: Yes. But
     check with a lawyer if you’re not sure. It’s okay with me if you use it
     but do so at your own risk.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: Can I send
     you a sample of the nifty thing I created with your fonts?</li>
 <li>A: Of course.
     Check <a href="http://www.typodermic.com/about.html">www.typodermic.com/about.html</a>
     for my current email or mailing address.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: Can you
     make a custom font for me?</li>
 <li>A: Possibly.
     Check <a href="http://typodermic.com/custom.html">www.typodermic.com/custom.html</a>
     for details.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: I want to
     sell software that includes you font files.</li>
 <li>A: Contact me
     first at <a href="http://www.typodermic.com/about.html">www.typodermic.com/about.html</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: I want to
     sell rubber stamp alphabets, alphabet punches or stencil alphabets using
     your font designs.</li>
 <li>A: Contact me
     first at <a href="http://www.typodermic.com/about.html">www.typodermic.com/about.html</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: My
     software won’t let me embed one of your fonts.</li>
 <li>A: You may
     have an old version of one of the fonts from Larabie Fonts. Uninstall it
     and install a current version.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Q: Can you
     help me find a font?</li>
 <li>A: Yes, but
     don’t email me with your question. Please post your question on the
     Larabie Fonts font forum: <a href="http://www.larabiefonts.com/info.html">www.larabiefonts.com/info.html</a>.</li>
